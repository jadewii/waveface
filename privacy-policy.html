    <h1>WaveFace Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 19, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>WaveFace ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our iOS application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>WaveFace does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app operates entirely on your device.</p>

    <h2>Audio Processing</h2>
    <p>All audio generation and playback occurs locally on your device. No audio data is recorded, stored, or transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>If you make an in-app purchase to unlock premium waveforms, the transaction is processed securely through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. Apple's Privacy Policy governs how your payment data is handled.</p>

    <p>Purchase records are stored locally on your device and synced via iCloud according to Apple's StoreKit framework. We only verify purchase receipts with Apple's servers to confirm valid transactions.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>WaveFace does not use analytics services or tracking technologies. We do not collect usage data, crash reports, or any other telemetry.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does not integrate with any third-party services except Apple's StoreKit for in-app purchases.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not knowingly collect information from children. The app is suitable for all ages and does not require any personal information to use.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect personal data, there is no personal data to secure. All app functionality operates locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
